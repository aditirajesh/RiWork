Riwork is an application to optimize hybrid office space allocation, utilizing advanced AI techniques and modern web technologies. The application was designed to balance several factors such as employees' distance from the office and their usual team collaborations.

Detailed Explanation:

1. **Database Management:** Employee entries and company details were efficiently managed using MongoDB. This NoSQL database was chosen for its scalability and flexibility in handling unstructured data, which was crucial for storing diverse and dynamic employee and company information.

2. **Algorithm Development:** The core algorithm for allocating office space to employees was driven by a genetic algorithm. This AI technique was ideal for solving the complex optimization problem, as it could evolve solutions over generations, balancing multiple factors to achieve the most efficient allocation.

3. **Front-End and User Authentication:** Streamlit was utilized to create the user interface and handle user authentication. Streamlit's simplicity and capability to build interactive web applications with minimal code made it an excellent choice for developing the front end. It allowed for a seamless user experience where employees could log in, view their allocated spaces, and provide feedback.
